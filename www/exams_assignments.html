    </div>
    <div class="row" style="padding-top: 5px;">
        <p>
            The midterm exam is a take home exam. The exam is a set of practical exercises.
            The practical exercises involve writing code (for programming track), and using database systems
            to solve problems, e.g. writing queries, defining schema, etc. We expect to assign the midterm on 19-Feb-21
        and you have one week to complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, there will be a short, proctored quiz on the day we release the take home midterm. We will
            ensure that we have online sessions at times that accomodate remote students' time zones. We expect
            students who have chosen to take the class on-campus may take the exam during the lecture in the classroom,
            or online during the assigned time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal with the quiz is to test you on the type of questions and topics that often occuring during
            job interviews. This helps you prepare.

                <p>Description:</p>
                <p>Experience using database technology and systems is valuable. There are many technologies that we will
                use during the course. Installing and configuring the diverse software on personal devices can be
                difficult. The IT world is rapidly moving to cloud based services, including
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database">Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS).</a>

                <p>We will primarily use Amazon Web Services (AWS). Please signup with AWS at the
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">"free tier level."</a> It is best to create a new AWS account
                for this class if you already have an AWS account. The signup process requires a credit card. We will
                avoid using services that create charges, and you also get a credit against services you use that incur
                charges. If you do not have a credit card, you can signup for an
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/">AWS Educate (Starter) Account.</a> This
                should not require a credit card.

                <p>We will use the discussion thread on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kjalznyke781r4?cid=7">Piazza for
                    HW0</a> to answer questions and resolve issues you encounter. Please post comments and questions.
                Also, please read the discussion thread before posting new questions or issues.
                <p>
                Administrators, analysts, developers and data scientists interact with databases using various tools.
                This semester, one tool we will use is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/">JetBrains DataGrip.</a>
                JetBrains provides free student licenses to all for all of their products. Please
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students">register,</a> set up an
                account and get the license key. You can then download, activate and start DataGrip. You should download
                the professional edition.
                <p>
                Students who want to follow the programming track <b>MUST</b> also download and activate
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm.</a> You can use the same license you received for
                DataGrip. Please download the <b>professional edition.</b> <i>We strong recommend PyCharm for ll
                students.</i>
                <p>
                The final setup step is installing Anaconda. Follow the instructions for
                <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">
                "installing just for me."</a> We recommend that you install a new instance in a new location if you already have
                a copy of Anaconda, but you can use an existing 3.7 or 3.8 installation.
                <p>
                We will provide a video tutorial for accomplishing some of the tasks for HW0. The HW0 tasks are:
                <ol>
                <li>Signup for AWS, install DataGrip, install PyCharm and install Anaconda.</li>
                <li>Create a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/MySQL">MySQL</a> instances on the
                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">AWS Relational Data Service.</a> Please follow the
                    <a href="./Assets/Videos/rds_setup.mp4">video tutorial.</a>
                </li>
                <li>Register for a JetBrains account and get a license key. You will have an account and
                login information to activate your software. Download DataGrip, install and open to test your
                installation.
                </li>
                <li>

                <p>Programming Description:</p>

                <p> The first part of this homework will be more theoretical and will focus on different aspects of relational database systems.
                    It was designed for students to better understand building blocks, namely different types of keys, relationships, and definitions.
                    This section will also ask you to model a database using <a href="https://Lucidchart.com">Lucid Chart </a>. You will also become
                    familiar with relational algebra, which is a theoretical declarative query language. These concepts are integral and important to
                    understand before diving into the code and applications.

                </p>
                <p> The next section of the homework is an application based where you will first "clean up" the lahman2019 database that you loaded in HW0.
                Data cleaning is an integral part of DBMS and is something that you will need to know for industry. In the homework we ask you to add primary
                 and foreign keys, change column types, take care of null fields and add appropriate columns. You will need
                to do this for both the People and Batting Tables. All of this can be done within the DataGrips editor, where you can copy and paste the SQL Script
                generated from the Modify Table pop-up. For each change you make to the tables, we want to you explain <i> why </i> you are making the change and why it is important.
                Being a good data engineer does not just consist of knowing SQL and being able to work with different applications, but higher thinking and being able to explain
                every design choice you made. We then ask you some SQL queries, which should be fairly simplistic. You might want to check out documentation on
                    <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-aggregate-functions/">aggregate functions.> </a> </p>

                <p> The final section of this homework is asking for you to implement basic query functions to manipulate CSV files. You will build on this code later in the semester,
                but for now it is important that not only does each function perform according to its definition but that you add integrity constraints. Try manipulating tables in SQL
                with primary keys, and figure out what you are allowed to do and what throws errors - your methods are simpler but should perform in the same manner. </p>

                <p> When completed, please PDF your .ipnyb and upload it to GradeScope, then upload your .zip file containing your code, and all other items in the subsequent
                    assignment section. </p>

                <p>Non-Programming Description:</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                The next section of the homework is application based. You will first load CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.
                <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html">Here is the documentation. </a>. Then you will upload this DataFrame to SQL.
                All of the code, save 2 lines and your log-in info, is written for you. Be sure to understand what each line is achieving.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then you will "clean up" the lahman2019 database that you loaded in HW0.
                Data cleaning is an integral part of DBMS and is something that you will need to know for industry. In the homework we ask you to add primary
                 and foreign keys, change column types, take care of null fields and add appropriate columns. Some of these tasks are better to be accomplished in SQL,
                like adding keys and changing column types. All of this can be done within the DataGrips editor, where you can copy and paste the SQL Script
                generated from the Modify Table pop-up. However, using pandas is an effective way to manipulate strings or add columns to dataframes, which is why
                we ask you to also manipulate the dataframe and then upload those changes to SQL.
                For each change we ask you to make, it should specify whether we want you to use SQL or Python. You will need
                to do this for the People, Batting and Teams Tables.  For each change you make to the tables, we want to you explain <i> why </i> you are making the change and why it is important.
                Being a good data engineer does not just consist of knowing SQL and being able to work with different applications, but higher thinking and being able to explain
                every design choice you made. We then ask you some SQL queries, which increase in difficulty. You might want to check out documentation on
                    <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-aggregate-functions/">aggregate functions.> </a>
